            Many fall but we rise on top
            From the depths now we climb back up
            You think we're done
            But we're never done until it's won
            So we
            So we get it non-stop
            Many fall but we rise on top
            From the depths now we climb back up
            You think we're done
            But we're never done until it's won
            So we
            So we get it non-stop
            Listen
            This is my soundtrack to fuel my hustle
            This is my reign match me rise out of the rubble
            It's a conscience thing
            Don't want no trouble
            Just trying to come up
            Level never stumbled
            I'm on a mission, I won't trip
            We keep it moving, up, up we don't sit
            We straight
            We straight focused, we don't slip
            You thought wrong
            'Cause I'm never gonna quit
            Many fall but we rise on top
            From the depths now we climb back up
            You think we're done
            But we're never done until it's won
            So we
            So we get it non-stop
            Many fall but we rise on top
            From the depths now we climb back up
            You think we're done
            But we're never done until it's won
            So we
            So we get it non-stop
            This is my soundtrack
            No one move a muscle
            Yeah, that's the sound that gets me going, may be subtle
            A silent thing, now closer to a rustle
            Now banging loud
            Hustle keep the hustle
            I'm on a mission, I won't trip
            We keep it moving, up, up we don't sit
            We straight focused, we don't slip
            You
            You thought wrong
            'Cause I'm never gonna quit
            Many fall but we rise on top
            From the depths now we climb back up
            You think we're done
            But we're never done until it's won
            So we
            So we get it non-stop
            Many fall but we rise on top
            From the depths now we climb back up
            You think we're done
            But we're never done until it's won
            So we
            So we get it non-stop
            Many fall but we rise on top
            From the depths now we climb back up
            You think we're done
            But we're never done until it's won
            So we
            So we get it non-stop
            Many fall but we rise on top
            From the depths now we climb back up
            You think we're done
            But we're never done until it's won
            So we
            So we get it non-stop...
